# lox-testrunner-python
Python-based Test Runner for Lox Language Test Suite (from "Crafting Interpreters")

**WORK IN PROGRESS** (see `dev` branch for most recent activity)

This is a port of [`test.dart`](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/01e6f5b8f3e5dfa65674c2f9cf4700d73ab41cf8/tool/bin/test.dart) from the official [`craftinginterpreters` repo](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters). This is intended to make it easier to run the [test suite defined there](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test) for those who find it easier to depend on Python rather than [Dart](https://dart.dev/).
